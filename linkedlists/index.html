    <p>arrays have an advantage over linked lists in pop(), because removing an item from the end of an array is O(1), while in a linked list it is O(n).
        but in removing the first item, a linkedList is O(1), and an array is O(n), because the array must correct the index of all proceeding entries when the front is shift()'ed.
        finding an item by index for array is O(1). finding an item by index of a linkedlist is O(n). we cannot access a node without iterating through the list
